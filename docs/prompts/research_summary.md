## Usage Guidelines

### Technical Summary
- Include key methodology details
- Highlight main contributions
- Summarize experimental results
- Discuss limitations and future work
- Use appropriate technical terminology

### General Audience Summary
- Avoid jargon or explain when necessary
- Use analogies and examples
- Focus on practical implications
- Keep explanations clear and concise
- Include visual descriptions where helpful

### Korean Technical Summary
- Use standard Korean technical terms
- Include English terms in parentheses
- Maintain academic tone
- Explain complex concepts clearly
- Consider Korean academic context

## Examples

### Technical Summary Example
Input: [Research paper on new attention mechanism]
Output: "The paper introduces Multi-Query Attention (MQA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) while maintaining model performance. The authors demonstrate a 30% reduction in memory usage and 45% faster inference time compared to standard attention mechanisms.

Experimental results on standard NLP benchmarks show comparable or better performance across all tested metrics. The method is particularly effective for long-sequence tasks."

### General Audience Summary Example
Input: [Same paper on attention mechanism]
Output: "Researchers have developed a new way to help AI models process information more efficiently, similar to how humans can quickly focus on important details in a crowded room. This new method, called Multi-Query Attention, helps AI systems work faster and use less computer memory, while still maintaining their ability to understand and process information accurately.

Think of it like having a smart filing system that helps you quickly find important documents, instead of having to look through every single paper one by one."

### Korean Technical Summary Example
Input: [Technical summary of attention mechanism]
Output: "연구진은 Multi-Query Attention (MQA)이라는 새로운 어텐션 메커니즘을 제안했습니다. 이 방식은 계산 복잡도를 O(n²)에서 O(n log n)으로 줄이면서도 모델 성능을 유지합니다. 

실험 결과, 표준 NLP 벤치마크에서 모든 테스트된 지표에서 비슷하거나 더 나은 성능을 보여주었으며, 특히 긴 시퀀스 작업에서 효과적입니다."
